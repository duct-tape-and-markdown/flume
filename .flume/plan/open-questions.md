# Open Questions

Decisions parked for human input. Each question is a `##` subsection with status, context, options, and recommended disposition.

Status markers:
- **PARKED** — no movement until human resolves
- **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** — some progress; remaining ambiguity blocks closure
- **NEEDS AMENDMENT** — answer is clear; requires a spec edit to close

## The release publish is hand-run, and `spec/cli.md` ratifies that (PARKED — needs a spec amendment)

Drained from the inbox (2026-09-08, human via flume-main). 0.14.0's publish
stalled a day on a dead token: CLAUDE.md named a key `.env` did not hold, the
key it did hold had expired in May, and `pnpm publish` ignored the env-var auth
form and read `~/.npmrc`, surfacing as a 404 on the PUT. Tag and commit were
already pushed, so the registry lagged the tag by a day.

**Not derivable as filed.** `spec/cli.md` *Versioning policy* currently states
"The version bump and `npm publish` are human-performed at cut time." A tagged
CI publish contradicts that line, so the line moves first.

Shape the finding proposes, carried here so the answering session need not
re-derive it — temper's `.github/workflows/release.yml`: `on: push: tags:
["v*"]`, publish with `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` through `setup-node`'s
`registry-url`, **idempotent** (skip when `npm view <pkg>@<version>` already
resolves), and a post-publish smoke that installs the published tarball from
the registry and runs the shim — `scripts/smoke-install.mjs` already does this
against a local pack; the job points it at the registry.

Two things are the operator's regardless of the ruling: setting the repo
secret, and whether release automation is wanted at all for a package whose
cut is deliberately hand-curated (changelog mining, `smoke:install`).
`.github/**` is already inside build's fence, so the work ships the moment the
spec line moves.

## The `spec/jobs.md` ignore block names a retired file, `last-tick.json` (NEEDS AMENDMENT)

**`last-tick.json` no longer exists.** Drained from
`RUNTIME-IGNORES-NAMES-THE-TICK-ARTIFACTS`'s note. The block lists `last-tick.json`;
nothing in `src/` writes that name. The per-tick verdict file is `tick-verdict.json`
(`STATE_ROOT_NAMES.tickVerdict`), and `CHANGELOG.md:1357` records the rename.
`README.md` and `docs/CHAIN-AUTHORING.md` both already teach the new name. Build
shipped the accessor's name rather than the spec's — an ignore line for
`last-tick.json` would ignore a file no tick creates while leaving the real one
trackable, which is the defect that entry existed to close — so `RUNTIME_IGNORES` now
reads one line off the spec block verbatim. No agreement pin is driven off the block
today; the first one authored would fail against the runtime.

**Recommend:** `last-tick.json` → `tick-verdict.json`. `spec/` is human-only; it is not
a code change. This repo's own `.gitignore` carries the stale `.flume/last-tick.json`
line too — harmless (it ignores nothing), and inside build's fence, so it rides
whatever entry the amendment files.

**The first half closed, and its code half shipped.** The block was also missing
`merging/`; the amendment landed at `17cf6a3` and `RUNTIME-IGNORES-NAMES-MERGING`
shipped on 2026-09-11.

**A second fork that ship raised — pin the block, or shrink it to a pointer?**
Drained from that entry's note; verified on disk. `docs/CHAIN-AUTHORING.md`'s copy of
this same list is equality-pinned to `RUNTIME_IGNORES` (`tests/retired-narration.test.ts`,
"the chain-authoring doc's job-seed gitignore list names every entry RUNTIME_IGNORES
carries and no others") and structurally cannot drift. The spec's copy
(`spec/jobs.md:105-116`) is pinned by nothing — which is why the stale name above sits in
the spec and not in the doc, and why the `merging/` gap stayed open long enough to need an
entry. A drift the pinned copy cannot have is evidence about the unpinned one. Two closes,
both spec edits, so the choice is the human's:

- **Pin it.** A second equality pin reading the fenced block through `RUNTIME_IGNORES`.
  Cheapest, and the spec section stays readable standing alone. Red until the name fix
  above lands, so it ships after that amendment, never with it.
- **Shrink it to a pointer** at `RUNTIME_IGNORES` (`.claude/rules/engineering.md`,
  *Derived state is computed, never restated beside its source* — "in artifacts, the same
  bar"). Removes the drift surface instead of policing it. Against it: in this pipeline
  the spec is upstream of the code, so a spec section citing `src/` inverts the flow
  `spec-plan-build.md` rests on, and a reader can no longer evaluate the section without
  opening the tree.

**Recommend the pin** — it buys the drift refusal without inverting the pipeline, and the
merged set is short enough that carrying it twice costs little. Either way the name fix
lands first.

## The degraded chain load also rebases the pending count, and two spec sections say otherwise (NEEDS AMENDMENT)

Drained from `DOCS-CLI-CHAIN-LOAD-REPORTED`'s note (2026-09-11 build wave).
`loadChainForObservation` (`src/cliChainLoad.ts`) reports two costs of a failed
load, and the code takes both: the withheld friction/capability lines, **and**
the pending count falling back to the default queue path — `chain?.pendingPath`
threads into `resolvePendingPath` at `src/cli.ts:365` and into `jobStatus` at
`src/cliJobVerbs.ts:44`.

Two spec sections name only the first, and one of them denies the second
outright:

- `spec/cli.md`, *`flume status` owes exactly this* — item 5 states the count
  reads `<flumeDir>/plan/pending.json`, and item 6 then says "nothing above
  this line is withheld". For a chain declaring a non-default `pendingPath`,
  item 5 is false the moment the load fails: the degraded count reads a
  different file than the healthy one.
- `spec/jobs.md`, *`flume job status`* — "the entry count from
  `<jobdir>/plan/pending.json`", and the best-effort bullet stops at "withholds
  the friction counts".

**Not a code defect.** `resolvePendingPath` is the single resolver
(`src/paths.ts:155`) and both call sites already thread the declared path; both
sites carry a comment naming the fallback. `docs/CLI.md` now states it too —
the doc is ahead of the spec, which is the wrong direction for this pipeline.

**Recommend:** amend both sections to say the count resolves through
`Chain.pendingPath` when the chain loads and through the default relative path
when it does not, and soften item 6's "nothing above this line is withheld" to
exclude the queue path it does not cover. The alternative — ruling that a
degraded count must refuse rather than rebase (`engineering.md`, *Loud or
nothing*) — is a behavior change, and a plausible one: a `pending: N` read off
the wrong file is a confident wrong answer where `pending: unknown` would not
be. If that is the ruling, say so and this becomes an entry instead.

**The sweep-lens half of this finding** — `docs/CLI.md`'s `flume job status`
paragraph asserting "no chain load" while the code takes one — closed with the
spec-writing ruling (`7367b79`): the sweep now reads `spec/` against
`.claude/rules/spec-writing.md` for restatement, and the generator the doc copy
was downstream of is gone. The amendment above is what remains.

## `docs/INTENT.md`'s quality-lenses decision has a fired arming condition (PARKED)

Drained from `INTENT-DOC-RECONCILED`'s note; verified on disk. The
"Decided, not yet executed — quality lenses in the loop" section closes with
"Sequencing: arm after the v0.11 boundary line ships" (`docs/INTENT.md:67`).
`package.json` is `0.14.0`, so the stated gate fired two lines back while the
decision stayed unexecuted. The prose therefore reads "not yet due" when it is due —
`engineering.md` *Narration is the ladder's bottom rung*, **Prefer the condition to
the era**, firing on a live section rather than a dead one.

The release line was never the real gate. The section names its own blocker one
paragraph up: the correctness-adjacency filing bar "demotes exactly the findings
these lenses produce", and the fork it poses — a quality lane that batches pure-shape
debt into a dedicated wave, or a bar carve-out for reuse findings — is unresolved.
That is the condition; `v0.11` was the era standing in for it.

Options:

- **Arm it.** Resolve the filing-bar fork, then add `reuse` and `efficiency` sections
  to `.claude/rules/engineering.md`. A phrase delta then arms a full-domain posture
  rotation and the loop gains the lenses with no engine or chain change — the
  section's own claimed mechanism. Costs one full rotation of sweep ticks.
- **Restate the condition** (recommended minimum). Replace the release-line sequencing
  with the filing-bar fork it was standing in for, so a later reader evaluates
  something observable. Ships as a pending entry the moment the replacement wording is
  ruled — `docs/` is inside build's fence.
- **Retire the decision.** The ruling is from 2026-07-31 and three release lines have
  passed without it; if the lenses are no longer wanted, the section goes and git keeps
  the record.

Parked rather than filed because arming, restating and retiring are three different
answers about whether the lenses are still wanted, and the section is a design-intent
ruling — plan choosing among them would be filling a gap silently.

## The quarantine key excludes `observedFiles`, and `spec/loop.md` says "a hash of its bytes" (NEEDS AMENDMENT)

Drained from `QUARANTINE-KEYS-THE-ENTRY-AS-READ`'s note; verified on disk.
`spec/loop.md` *Repeated identical failures* keys the run-scoped quarantine by
"its slug and a hash of its bytes in `pending.json`". `quarantineKey`
(`src/Dispatcher.ts:768-801`) hashes the entry **minus `observedFiles`**, and
declares the divergence at the site.

The exclusion is load-bearing, not a shortcut. `commitPendingUpdate` merges a
failed attempt's footprint into `entry.observedFiles` (`src/Dispatcher.ts:4826`)
in the *same* wave that blames the entry, so a whole-bytes hash mints a fresh
key on the next read: every merge- and gate-stage quarantine lifts its own hold
one tick later and the run re-attempts the same wall at full agent price — the
burn the section exists to prevent. Provision-stage failures are unaffected (no
`mergeOutcome`, so no write-back). Every other write-back — `blockedBy` →
`open` — is a real state change and re-keys deliberately, which is the behavior
the sentence wants to keep.

**Recommend:** amend the bullet so the hash is stated over the entry *as
declared*, naming `observedFiles` as the engine's own accretion that is excluded
— the code's rule, said once in the spec, at which point the declared divergence
at `quarantineKey` shrinks to a pointer (`engineering.md`, *Narration is the
ladder's bottom rung*).

The alternative is a behavior change rather than a spec edit: rule that the key
must cover the whole entry, and move the `observedFiles` merge out of the
blaming wave so the accretion no longer re-keys. That is the larger change and
it buys nothing the exclusion does not already buy — but if it is the ruling,
say so and this becomes an entry against `commitPendingUpdate`.

## A contract-touching entry ships mid-run with no ordering and no signal (PARKED)

Drained from the inbox (2026-09-11, human). Loop of 2026-09-11, 15 ticks:
`QUARANTINE-KEYS-THE-ENTRY-AS-READ` shipped at wave 6 and re-keyed
`FLUME_QUARANTINED_SLUGS` from a bare slug to `slug@hash`. The resident supervisor
kept sending the old form; wave 7's fresh children compared it against the new key,
matched nothing, and re-picked two entries quarantined "for the rest of this run".
Harmless here — both merged — but it is `spec/loop.md` *A run finishes on the
contract it started with* failing with no signal at all, and the key is documented as
an opaque equality key "never parsed apart by either side of the channel"
(`src/Dispatcher.ts:869`), which is exactly why neither side can notice the skew.
Observed at `bec94406`.

**`.flume/PROTOCOL.md` rule 6 does not reach it.** Rule 6 orders an entry against *the
entry that completes the contract's other half*. Here there is no other half: the
change is complete in one entry, and its effect is simply deferred to the next run.
Plan filed nothing because nothing in the rule told it to.

Options, in rising cost:

- **Say it in the rule.** Rule 6 gains the single-entry case — an entry changing a
  supervisor↔child contract with no paired entry carries a note that its effect lands
  at the next run start. Prose, one `chore(flume):`, zero mechanism, and one forgetful
  plan tick from being nothing.
- **Mechanize on existing surface**, which `spec/loop.md` sanctions in the same
  paragraph ("a chain may mechanize this … its build handoff writing the stop flag
  after shipping an entry plan marked contract-touching"): this chain's
  `entryExtension` gains the flag and `build.handoff` writes the stop flag when a
  shipped entry carries it. Chain-side only, no engine change; costs a relaunch per
  such ship, which is the point.
- **Engine fence.** The spec names its own arming condition — "a second livelock
  despite the documented rule" — and this was not a livelock, so by the spec's own
  terms it has not fired.

**Recommend** the second: it is the mechanism the spec already points at, it lives
entirely in `.flume/chain.ts` plus the extension declaration, and it degrades to the
first when the flag goes unset. Parked rather than filed because both edits are
human-only — `spec/`, `.flume/PROTOCOL.md` and `.flume/chain.ts` are outside every
phase lane.

## A `tests[]` line homed in the integration lane is invisible to the vitest gate (NEEDS AMENDMENT)

Drained from `CASCADE-SHOULDRUN-FROM-DISK`'s park (2026-09-11 build wave); verified
on disk. The build gate runs `vitest run --reporter=json` (`.flume/chain.ts:728`) —
the **fast** lane, and `vitest.config.ts` excludes `*.integration.test.ts` from it.
So a `tests[]` line whose only passing test lands in `tests/*.integration.test.ts`
is absent from the gate's report, and the entry reverts with "N of N named
behavior(s) have no passing test" no matter how green the work is. That is exactly
what cost this entry a wave: plan declared the decline case against
`tests/examples.integration.test.ts`, which the gate cannot see.

**Nothing warns at plan time, and nothing can.** `.flume/prompts/plan-discipline.md`
(*Tests ride the entry, and the gate reads them*) says "the file a test lands in is
build's call" — true, and the constraint the sentence omits is that the call is
bounded to the fast lane. The `pendingGate` cannot check it: the file does not exist
when plan derives.

**Recommend** one clause in that paragraph — a `tests[]` line names a behavior a
**fast-lane** test can carry; work whose only honest home is the integration lane
declares its named behavior over the fast-lane surface it exposes, or carries no
`tests[]` line at all. No fork, no mechanism, one `chore(flume):`. Parked only
because `.flume/prompts/**` is outside every phase lane.

**Reported independently from the field** (inbox, 2026-09-11, human), which
names the alternative and rejects it: the `vitest` gate could run the
integration lane whenever an entry touches `examples/` — a second full suite
per merge, paid on every such entry to buy a lane the fast one already
exposes. The prose clause above stays the right default.

I have re-homed every `CASCADE-*` entry onto `tests/examples.test.ts`
meanwhile, so the queue does not re-hit this wall while the wording is ruled.

## `spec/worktrees.md` names a test file, and neither half of the spec-lint pin reaches it (NEEDS AMENDMENT)

Drained from `SPEC-SYMBOL-CITES-PINNED`'s note (2026-09-11 build wave); verified
on disk. `spec/worktrees.md`, *Integration lane*: "naming it here would move most
of `Dispatcher.test.ts` for a cost it does not pay." `spec-writing.md` (*A claim
names behavior, never location*) refuses "A test title or a fixture" outright, so
the corpus is carrying a live violation of its own page.

**Neither needle reaches it, both by design.** The path half anchors on `src/`.
The symbol half drops any dotted token whose last segment is a filename tail —
and that exclusion is itself pinned: `Dispatcher.test.ts` is the literal
over-fire case its sensitivity test asserts must stay unflagged.

**Build cannot close this.** `spec/` is human-only, so a widened needle goes red
on the current corpus with no lane able to make it green. `SPEC-TEST-CITES-PINNED`
shipped scoped to a `tests/` root for that reason, and its sensitivity pin now
asserts `Dispatcher.test.ts` and the `*.integration.test.ts` glob stay unflagged.

**So the rootless half is unwatched, and this question is the only thing watching
it.** Three sites today: `Dispatcher.test.ts` in `spec/worktrees.md`, and the glob
in `spec/worktrees.md` and `spec/chain.md`. Nothing on disk fails if a page grows a
fourth. Whichever way this resolves, the needle widens (or the allowlist lands) in
that same commit.

Options:

- **Rewrite the sentence to name the behavior** (recommended). The point it makes
  is real — raw `git` plumbing on temp fixtures is not a lane trigger, and naming
  it would relocate most of the dispatcher's default-lane suite for a cost it does
  not pay. "most of the dispatcher's default-lane suite" carries the same measured
  claim with no filename. One human `spec:` edit; the needle then widens to bare
  `*.test.ts` filenames and is green on the first tick that ships it.
- **Allowlist the cite**, the way `src/index.ts` and `src/Dispatcher.ts` are
  allowlisted on the path half. Rejected here: those two are allowlisted because
  the module *is* the claim's subject — the page names an export of `src/index.ts`
  as public surface, and the deep-import specifier is the string a consumer types.
  The page names no test as anything, so an allowlist entry would ratify a shape
  it refuses outright.
- **Leave the clause prose-only.** The refusal stays at the ladder's bottom rung
  with a known live violation sitting under it.

**One grammar decision rides along either way.** `*.integration.test.ts` appears
in `spec/worktrees.md` and `spec/chain.md`. I read that as the lane's
*convention* — the marker a consumer types, and the claim's own subject — not a
cite of a particular test, so a widened needle should match a concrete filename
and leave the glob. Say so if you read it the other way; it changes the needle's
grammar, not the spec edit.
