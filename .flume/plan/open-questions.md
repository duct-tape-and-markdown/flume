## BUILD-PARK-COMMIT-BEFORE-BAIL — voluntary-bail park notes die with the worktree

**PARKED**

Context: v0.7 §13 established that when build's fence conflicts with the work, the tick parks a note in `open-questions.md` and bails rather than committing into a guaranteed revert — that instruction itself lives in `prompts/build.md`, applied by operator commit (`PROMPTS-BUILD-FENCE-INSTRUCTION`, closed `db645f5`) since prompts sit outside every phase's fence. §15 (shipped `c8ccfd2`) made plan wake on a voluntary-bail, but the park note is written inside the fanout worktree and never committed — worktree cleanup at wave end destroys it, so plan wakes with zero visibility into why. Observed live: the PENDING-SCHEMA-CORE-EXTENSION-SPLIT wave bailed with an uncommitted park, reconstructable only from the session log.

Options:
1. **Prompt fix (recommended).** `prompts/build.md` instructs: when parking a note and bailing, commit that single-file `open-questions.md` edit before exiting (already within build's write allowance for that path) instead of leaving an uncommitted worktree diff. No new engine mechanism — same shape as the already-shipped §13/§15 operator legs.
2. **Engine salvage.** Dispatcher detects channel-path edits in a worktree on voluntary-bail and lands them as a park commit itself. More machinery than the gap needs; `.claude/rules/collaboration.md`'s complexity-is-a-signal rule favors option 1 unless prompt-level discipline can't be trusted to fire every time.

Recommendation: option 1, applied directly to `prompts/build.md` via `chore(flume):` commit — no pending entry, same class as `PROMPTS-BUILD-FENCE-INSTRUCTION`.
