// Narration pin (RETIRED-ROOTS-AND-MODEL-NARRATION, per
// .claude/rules/engineering.md "Narration is the ladder's bottom rung"):
// `FlumeApi.paths` and `ClaudeCodeOptions.model` replaced two shapes the
// engine used to make every chain author assemble by hand — a
// `process.env.FLUME_DIR ?? CHAIN_DIR` fallback for artifact placement, and
// `--model` pushed into `extraArgs`. Both replacements are typed, so the only
// place the retired shapes can still be taught is prose, where nothing
// mechanical was watching. This is that watch: the retirement promoted off
// the page onto a rung that fails.
//
// Scope is what a chain author reads to learn the shapes — published prose
// plus the engine's own doc comments. Excluded, each for a reason that is
// about the file's job rather than convenience:
//   - `tests/` — a test legitimately drives the retired argv through
//     `extraArgs` to pin that the passthrough still works
//     (tests/Agent.test.ts).
//   - `docs/MIGRATING-*.md` — a migration guide's job is to show the shape
//     you are leaving alongside the one you are moving to.
//   - `.flume/chain.ts` — the dogfood chain still carries four fallback legs,
//     tracked as its own work.
